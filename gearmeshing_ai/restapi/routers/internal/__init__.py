"""Internal utilities package for GearMeshing-AI REST API.

This package contains internal utilities and helpers that support
the REST API functionality, following duck typing principles.

Note: Most utility functions have been moved to core/models/io/utils.py
to create a cohesive I/O package. This package is reserved for
truly internal utilities that don't directly relate to I/O models.
